# Merge Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement

You are given two sorted arrays, `A` and `B`. Your task is to find and merge these arrays into a single sorted array `C`.

### Input

- Two sorted arrays, `A` and `B`, where 1 <= A.length, B.length <= 10^5.
- Elements of both arrays are integers, and the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Output

- A single sorted array, `C`, which is the merged result of arrays `A` and `B`.

### Example

Input:
Array A: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Array B: [2, 4, 6, 8]

Output:
Merged Array C: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
