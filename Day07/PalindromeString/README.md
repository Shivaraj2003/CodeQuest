# Problem Statement: Palindrome Checker

## Problem Description

You are tasked with developing a Java program that determines whether a given string is a palindrome, following specific conditions:

- **Case Insensitivity:** The program should treat uppercase and lowercase characters as equivalent.

- **Special Character and White Space Handling:** Special characters and white spaces should be ignored when checking for a palindrome. Only alphanumeric characters (letters and digits) should be considered.

## Input

The program should take a single string as input from the user. This string may contain a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, special characters, and white spaces.

## Output

The program should provide a clear indication of whether the input string is a palindrome or not. The output should be one of the following:

- "Palindrome" if the input, after applying the specified conditions, reads the same forwards and backwards.
- "Not a Palindrome" if the input, after applying the specified conditions, does not read the same forwards and backwards.

## Example

### Input
Ja 121 AJ

### Output
Palindrome
