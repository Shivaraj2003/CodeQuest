# Insertion Sort in Java

This Java program demonstrates the insertion sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers.

## Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It repeatedly takes the next element and inserts it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.
